# Brewing Perfection with Convolution Neural Networks and Caffe2

### Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify the ripeness of coffee beans based on images. Leveraging the "Coffee Fruit Maturity"[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cienciacafeto/coffee-fruit-maturity] dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of coffee cherries at different ripeness levels, the model will be trained to classify coffee beans as unripe, ripe, semi-dry, dry, or overripe.

### Dataset:
The dataset consists of over 800 labeled images of coffee cherries, with over 11000 segmented cherries with varying levels of ripeness. The dataset is skewed towards green cherries and includes only images of cherries still on the plant, with natural backgrounds.

### Project Structure:
- **Data Preprocessing:** The images will be preprocessed to enhance their quality and prepare them for model training. 
- **Model Training:** A CNN model will be developed and trained using the preprocessed images. The model will learn to classify coffee beans into their respective ripeness classes.
- **Evaluation:** The trained model's performance will be evaluated on a separate validation and test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
- **Deployment:** Once trained and validated, the model can be deployed for real-world use.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Caffe2
